## ErrorExamples Contract

The `ErrorExamples` contract is a simple example of how to handle errors and exceptions in a Solidity smart contract. It showcases three different error-handling mechanisms available in Solidity: `require`, `assert`, and `revert`.

### Purpose

The purpose of this contract is to demonstrate how to use the `require`, `assert`, and `revert` functions to enforce certain conditions in the contract and handle exceptional situations gracefully.

### Error Handling Functions

1. **requireFunction(uint256 _input)**
   - Description: This function uses the `require` statement to check if the input `_input` is greater than zero. If the condition is not met, it throws an error with a custom error message.
   - Error Message: "Input must be greater than zero"

2. **assertFunction(uint256 _input)**
   - Description: This function uses the `assert` statement to check if the input `_input` is greater than zero. If the condition is not met, it throws an error and reverts all changes made to the contract state.
   - Error Handling: Throws an error if the condition fails.

3. **revertFunction(uint256 _input)**
   - Description: This function checks if the input `_input` is equal to zero. If the condition is not met, it immediately terminates execution and reverts all changes made to the contract state.
   - Error Handling: Uses the `revert` statement with the error message "Input must not be zero" if the condition fails.

### Error Handling Best Practices

When writing smart contracts, it is crucial to implement proper error handling to avoid potential vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior. Here are some best practices for error handling:

1. Use `require` for Input Validation: Use `require` to validate function inputs and contract preconditions. This helps prevent invalid transactions from being processed and conserves gas.

2. Use `assert` for Internal Invariants: Use `assert` to check for internal consistency in your contract. It is typically used to catch bugs and should only be used to check for conditions that should never be false under normal circumstances.

3. Be Specific in Error Messages: Always provide clear and descriptive error messages when using `require` or `revert`. This helps users and developers understand why a particular operation failed.

4. Avoid Excessive Use of `assert`: Avoid using `assert` in situations where the condition could be false under normal operation, as it will consume all remaining gas and revert the entire transaction.

5. Consider Using Custom Error Codes: For more complex contracts, consider using custom error codes and enums to categorize different types of errors for easier error handling and debugging.
